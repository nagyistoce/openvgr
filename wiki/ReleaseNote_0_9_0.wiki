Remarkable changes from 0.8.1 are shown below. To view the details, please check a log of [http://code.google.com/p/openvgr/source/list our repository].

== Recognition RTCs ==
 * Threshold value for edge detection (EdgeStrength) has been normalized
  * In the previous version, user need to adjust the value when changes edge detection methods (EdgeDetectFunction). Now, magnitude of the value is 1/16 for EdgeDetectFunction = 0, and 1/96 for EdgeDetectFunction = 1. 
 * Evaluation performance has been slightly improved.
 * An experimental OpenMP support has been added.

== Calibration related programs ==
 * A name of a sample program for chessboard pattern detection has been changed from 'sample' to 'ichimatsu'.
 * An option character of ichimatsu for specifying an output file name (-w) is obsoleted, use '-o' instead.
